# BATTLE BOSS BATTLE

**NOTE: THIS IS AN OLD, OUTDATED PROJECT THAT IS NO LONGER BEING UPDATED**

Start with nothing and work your way to power to claim the title of Battle Boss in this three-part fight! Compete for raw materials to craft your gear and train your stats in the Crafting round, fight in a free-for-all against other players and the Battle Boss during the Battle round, and survive for as long as you can in the ever-increasing toxicity of the Armageddon round. Perform the best across the three rounds to earn the title of next game's Battle Boss!

I made this gamemode in two months for the gmodstore gamemode competition during the summer of 2020, with no prior experience in coding glua. I learned just about everything during the two month period so I'm quite happy with how it turned out.

Things I would like to change in the future:
 - Make the crafting and training menus look better (Basically a whole redesign)
 - Allow players to deconstruct items if they end up wanting to make a different one
 - Get professional, custom icons made for the gamemode
 - Make the consumable menu display how many consumables are left of each type
 - Add a HUD indicator that shows when a consumable is in effect, and how much time is left for it
 - Completely redo the scoreboard
 - Add a halo to the boss so everyone can see where they are at all times
 - Add a way for players to know where other players are during armageddon (to help end the round quicker)
 - Add short-lived ragdolls whenever a player dies
 - Add point tokens and stat boost tokens that spawn near the boss that non-boss players can pick up (to further incentivize fighting the boss)
 - Make it so the last person to attack someone gets points when that someone dies from armageddon toxicity or falling
 - Add config options so people wanting to host the gamemode on a server can more easily change things like round times, player stats, pity points, etc.
