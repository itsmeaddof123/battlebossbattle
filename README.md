# BATTLE BOSS BATTLE

Start with nothing and work your way to power to claim the title of Battle Boss in this three-part fight! Compete for raw materials to craft your gear and train your stats in the Crafting round, fight in a free-for-all against other players and the Battle Boss during the Battle round, and survive for as long as you can in the ever-increasing toxicity of the Armageddon round. Perform the best across the three rounds to earn the title of next game's Battle Boss!
